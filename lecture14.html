                Around 930 Willa married Berengar II of Italy.[4] 
                The marriage was arranged by Willa's paternal uncle Hugh of Italy.[5] 
                About 940, however, Berengar led an unsuccessful revolt of Italian nobles against Hugh. 
                Afterwards, he fled to the court of King Otto I of Germany. Although she was heavily pregnant, Willa left Italy, too, travelling through the Alps in the winter to rejoin her husband in Germany.[6]

                Computer Science 10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing (Spring 2015, UC Berkeley). 
                Instructor: Professor Dan Garcia. This course provide an introduction to the beauty and joy of computing,
                 dealing with the history, social implications, great principles, and future of computing
                 . We'll focus on some of the "Big Ideas" of computing, such as abstraction, design, recursion, concurrency, simulations, and the limits of computation. We'll show some beautiful applications of computing that have changed the world, talk about the history of computing, and where it will go in the future. Throughout the course, relevance will be emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. (from cs10.org)

                When Berengar was fighting against Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor in the early 960s,
                 Willa and her sons, Adalbert of Italy and Guy of Ivrea were frequently by his side.[11] 
                 After Otto deposed Berengar, Willa and Berengar were taken as prisoners to Bavaria.[12] 
                 After Berengar's death in 966 Willa retired to a nunnery in Bamberg, where she remained for the rest of her life.[13] The date of her death is not known exactly.
